------------------------ CUDA MANDELBROT REALTIME ZOOM -------------------------

A simple Mandelbrot renderer built with CUDA. It splits the screen up into a
load of tiles 32 pixels by 16 pixels and hands each tile off to a CUDA thread
block. The algorithm generates 256 different colour values which are rendered in
SDL. It uses single-precision IEEE floats, so artifacts appear at extreme zoom
levels. It runs at about 50fps on my CUDA card, which is an old GeForce 9600 GT.
It's about a factor of ten faster than the equivalent CPU implementation.

Here's a video showing roughly what it looks like when it's running:
